TOYO TANSO LOGO PLACEHOLDER

To complete the logo integration:

1. Save your Toyo Tanso logo image as "toyo-tanso-logo.png" in this directory
2. The logo should be in PNG format (preferred) or SVG
3. Recommended minimum width: 200px for good quality
4. The logo will automatically appear in the header of all pages

Current status: Logo integration is complete in the templates, waiting for actual logo file.

If you need to temporarily hide the logo:
- Comment out the <img> tag in templates/base.html (around line 136)
- Or add "display: none;" to the .company-logo CSS class
